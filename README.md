1. Project Overview
This is a Hostel Room Reservation Web App built in React, designed to simulate and manage room reservations with features like:
Booking 1â€“5 rooms at once.

Optimal room selection algorithm to minimize travel time.


Undo, Reset, Random Occupancy, and Export JSON features.


Interactive UI with Framer Motion animations.


The app is composed of:
UI logic (App.js) â€” manages state, user actions, and display.


Pure booking logic (bookingLogic.js) â€” implements selection algorithm.
2. Algorithmic Approach
2.1 Main Problem
Given:
A multi-floor hostel with rooms marked available, occupied, or booked.


A request to book k rooms (1 â‰¤ k â‰¤ 5).


Goal:
Prefer: Same-floor contiguous rooms (best for guest convenience).


Otherwise: Choose rooms that minimize combined vertical + horizontal travel time.



2.2 Algorithms Used
A. Same-Floor Contiguous Selection
Type: Sliding Window (Greedy + Minimal Span Search)
On a floor, rooms are represented by their index positions.


Sliding window of size k checks all possible contiguous segments.


Span = (max index âˆ’ min index) â†’ smallest span = best placement.


Why greedy works here: For same-floor selection, smallest contiguous span directly minimizes walking distance.


B. Multi-Floor Optimal Selection
Type: Exhaustive Search + Combinatorics
Uses compositions(k, n, maxPerFloor) to generate all ways of distributing k rooms across candidate floors (n = number of floors with available rooms).


For each distribution:


Picks the best contiguous block per floor using the same sliding window logic.


Calculates cost = travel time using calculateTravelTime():


Vertical cost: 2 Ã— (maxFloor - minFloor)


Horizontal cost: sum of (max idx âˆ’ min idx) per floor.


Keeps track of best overall combination.


This ensures globally optimal selection rather than greedy-only selection.
C. Fallback Greedy (Full Hotel)
Type: Global Sliding Window Across All Rooms
If exhaustive search fails (edge cases with scattered availability),


Sort all available rooms by (floor, index),


Run a sliding window of size k over the entire list,


Choose the set with the smallest travel time.



2.3 Additional Logic
Random Occupancy Generator:


Shuffles available rooms (Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle).


Occupies a percentage p of them randomly.


Undo Functionality:


Maintains a history stack (historyRef) with actions (random, toggle, booking).


Reverts the last change based on action type.


Export Booking:


Collects all booked rooms and travel time into a JSON file.



3. UI & State Management
React Hooks Used:


useMemo: For hotel model + initial map (performance).


useState: For tracking roomMap, booking count, last booking, etc.


useRef: For undo history storage (avoids re-renders).


Accessibility:


aria-label for screen readers.


Keyboard navigation via onKeyDown.


Animations:


Framer Motion for hover/tap effects & modal transitions.



4. Booking Priority Rules
Rule 1: Same floor, contiguous block of rooms.


Rule 2: If not possible, minimize combined travel distance across multiple floors.


Rule 3: If no optimal found, use greedy fallback.
